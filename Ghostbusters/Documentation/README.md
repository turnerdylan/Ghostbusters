## 1/19/2021 - Week 1 Prototype Preparation 

The initial prototype for Spooked! involves a blocked out version of our first level, the car ferry to the haunted island! We have cylinder block characters who can spawn in and scare capsule ghosts who will split into smaller and smaller ghosts, eventually disappearing.

## FA20 - Precedents Work
### Overcooked! 2
Our main takeaway from the Overcooked games is their combination of chaos and player flow. A game with good flow constantly has the player at the brink of failure so that when they do succeed they experience a great sense of accomplishment. Overcooked does this very well and it is something we want to strive for in our own game. Our game obviously has a different theme and we would like to link the chaos in our levels to that theme by having the ghost scaring activate effects and introduce a whole new sandbox for player fun experiences.

### Luigi's Mansion 3
The Luigiâ€™s Mansion series is a wonderful example of a fun, spooky, non-horror themed ghost game. The ghost hunting mechanics in LM3 involve a whole series of contraptions including a vacuum (for ghosts and also non-ghost sucking), a punger, a flashlight for stunning, a wind gust whoosh jump and a Luigi Doppelganger made out of goo named Gooigi. This allows for a huge range of ghost catching combinations. We want to emulate some of this variability but in a much simpler structure. We also want to create more dynamic ghost interactions, involving multiple players and key cooperation.

## FA20 - Previous Testing

### Unity Prototypes

Our initial testing involved creating some ghost AI to direct the movement of the ghosts within the scene (pictured on the left) and a few different ways to catch ghosts (pictured on the right). From these tests, we decided to pivot towards the players scaring the ghosts through different stages and catching them once they were vunerable.

### Style Research 

With the limited time of our team, we wanted to decide on a uniform design style for our 3D world so that we could all contribute assets to the development if need be. A sleek low poly style seemed feasible for our situation so we looked into a bunch of different games that include beautiful low poly design for insporation. Below are a few with shots from each game.
