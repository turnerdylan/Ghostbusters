## 1/19/2021 - Week 1 Prototype Preparation 

The initial prototype for Spooked! involves a blocked out version of our first level, the car ferry to the haunted island! We have cylinder block characters who can spawn in and scare capsule ghosts who will split into smaller and smaller ghosts, eventually disappearing.

## FA20 - Precedents Work
### Overcooked! 2
Our main takeaway from the Overcooked games is their combination of chaos and player flow. A game with good flow constantly has the player at the brink of failure so that when they do succeed they experience a great sense of accomplishment. Overcooked does this very well and it is something we want to strive for in our own game. Our game obviously has a different theme and we would like to link the chaos in our levels to that theme by having the ghost scaring activate effects and introduce a whole new sandbox for player fun experiences.

### Luigi's Mansion 3
The Luigi’s Mansion series is a wonderful example of a fun, spooky, non-horror themed ghost game. The ghost hunting mechanics in LM3 involve a whole series of contraptions including a vacuum (for ghosts and also non-ghost sucking), a punger, a flashlight for stunning, a wind gust whoosh jump and a Luigi Doppelganger made out of goo named Gooigi. This allows for a huge range of ghost catching combinations. We want to emulate some of this variability but in a much simpler structure. We also want to create more dynamic ghost interactions, involving multiple players and key cooperation.

## FA20 - Previous Testing

### Unity Prototypes

Our game mechanic test revolved around prototyping specific ghost catching player mechanics within Unity. This was further tested by running a few simple playtests to prototype certain mechanics and features of the game. The gif to the left demonstrates a scene in Unity that we have used for prototyping mechanics. This was a test to see if the base mechanic of chasing ghosts around was any fun and if it could be executed in a straightforward, scalable, and efficient manner.

We have multiple scenes in Unity that we have been using as prototyping spaces and where we can write various scripts for testing our mechanics. The gif to the right demonstrates a scene in Unity that we have used for prototyping mechanics. So far we have the ability to have multiple players at once and the ability to catch and trap enemies as well as various “weapons” for the players to use including an electric fence that both players must place together.

From these tests, we decided to pivot towards the players scaring the ghosts through different stages and catching them once they were vulnerable. Chasing them around and having many players in the scene at once proved to be quite fun and align with our player experience goals.

Our next line of testing involved trying out a few new forms of ghost movement, and scaring the ghosts to defeat them. In the prototype below, the player are pushed backwards when only one of them scares a ghost. In a successful scare, both players contribute and the ghost turns red. We also wanted to try out invisibility with the ghosts phasing in and out as the players try to scare them.

### Style Research 

With the limited time of our team, we wanted to decide on a uniform design style for our 3D world so that we could all contribute assets to the development if need be. A sleek low poly style seemed feasible for our situation so we looked into a bunch of different games that include beautiful low poly design for inspiration. Below are a few with shots from each game.

### Low Poly Prototypes
After deciding to pursue a low poly style for our assets, we moved forward in designing a few different characters, buildings, and scenes to try out the entire design flow for making these models. We are using Blender 2.9 for creating our 3D models with the goal of only using our own assets within this project. 

Some initial character ideas, a bread guy and a rolling cactus plant.

A few buildings that could exist in different places on our haunted island, a general building in town and a mushroom cottage for the enchanted forest.

One idea for the feel of a library level.
